# ATtiny85 Programming Board

This is a pcb I designed so that I can more easily program lots of ATtiny's for large quantities of devices. Uses an arduino uno to connect and trandfer code. Uses sockets so that the ATtiny's don'y have to be soldered in and can be easily tranfered from prpgramming to final location.
