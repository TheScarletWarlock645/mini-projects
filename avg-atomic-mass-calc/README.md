# Average Atomic Mass Calculator

This is a super basic calculator (written in python) used to calculate the average atomic mass from isotopes of an element. I made it for my chemistry class.

**Best use is to upload it to a TI-84 CE Plus Python if you have one and you can use it there an an aplication. Very useful**
